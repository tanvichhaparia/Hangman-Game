# Hangman-Game
Hangman is a word guessing game where one player picks a secret word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. Correct guesses reveal letters, while incorrect guesses add parts to a hangman figure. The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn. It's a fun game that tests deduction and vocabulary.
